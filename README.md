# accessible-nas-audio-web-client

This project aims to provide an accessible web client to use the Audio Station on the Synology NAS.
Thus far the Audio Station is only accessible via a very convoluted and complicated web interface (`/webman/`).
In addition it is not usable with a braille reader for visually impaired users as it doesn't follow best practices for accessibility.

A prototype with basic music search and streaming capability will be released in the following weeks.
